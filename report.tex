\section*{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this assignment has allowed us to delve deeper into the concepts of Calculus 2, including integration techniques. Through three exercises and 
MATLAB problems, we have gained a better understanding of how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios, and have strengthened our mathematical skills in the process.

In particular, we have learned how to evaluate differnt type of integrals using various methods. We have also studied maximum and mininum values of multivariable functions. Finally, we have investigated various applications of integrals which are arc length, Lagrange Multiplier method, ...

Overall, this assignment has been challenging but rewarding, and has provided us with valuable insights into the power and versatility of Calculus 2. We look forward to continuing our study of this fascinating subject, and applying our newfound knowledge to solve even more complex problems in the future.
